### Sprint Retrospective

- **Positives**

  - Completed the Sprint and met all user stories within the sprints "Definition of done"
  - Had quite a lot of confidence building the database and creating the project so far

- **Things I Learnt**

  - After having some issues when updating the database design and having to scaffold it again, I found that I would prefer to use a model-first approach in the future as it allows for more flexibility with changing the database without losing data or running into as many errors.
  - Really enjoyed first use of SCRUM and agile with regular stand-ups and a sprint review

- **Action Plan**

  - Continue with Sprint 2

  - No user stories unfinished in Sprint 1
